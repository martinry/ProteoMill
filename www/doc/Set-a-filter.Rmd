Expression matrices derived from mass spectrometry data often contain many missing values. Rows with a high abundance of missing values can be considered uninformative for differential expression analysis and should be removed. The feature presented here lets you set a threshold for how many missing values should be allowed in each condition/group.

To skip this step and continue the analysis, set the cutoff to 100.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r tmp, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", out.height="20%",fig.cap="Number of rows affected by missing values",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../img/filter1.png","../img/filter2.png"))
```


The plots should be interpreted as the number of rows with at least X number of missing values in any sample, before (left image) and after (right image) cutoff.

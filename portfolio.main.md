> ### Quantative Omics Discovery Base - A web-based workflow for improved functional enrichment analysis of comparative proteomic expression data

> **Introduction.** With the increasing amounts of data generated when studying the underlying mechanisms of a disease there is a growing need of well-adapted tools for accurate biological interpretation of the results. Here we demonstrate improved methods for enrichment analysis with the implementation of multiple computational approaches, integrated as an interactive web-application.

> **Methods.** The tool was developed in the statistical programming language R. Helper functions have been written in Python and jQuery and database management was done in SQLite. Medial meniscus samples from healthy donors were the main dataset used in the analysis.

> **Discussion and conclusion.** The study introduces novel approaches to perform cluster- and network analysis in an intuitive workflow and improves first generation over-representation analysis by integrating expression data into the statistical analysis. The new ways of visualizing protein-protein interactions may be the foundation for the identification of novel biomarkers.
